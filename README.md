Data Handling: Processed 10-year CDS spread data for JP Morgan (representing your side) and Morgan Stanley (representing the counterparty), focusing on hazard rate calculations and probabilistic modeling.

Probability of Default (PD) Estimation: You calculated both marginal and cumulative PDs, using stochastic approaches for PD and Exposure at Default (EAD).

Interest Rate Modeling: The Vasicek model was employed to model the term structure and simulate different interest rate paths. You conducted 1000 simulation runs to understand potential future values of Interest Rate Swaps (IRS).

Default Simulation: Utilizing random numbers, you simulated default events based on the cumulative PDs, leading to calculation of exposure for both parties.

CVA and DVA Calculation: Using a fixed Loss Given Default (LGD), you calculated both the CVA (Credit Valuation Adjustment) and DVA (Debt Valuation Adjustment) to understand the credit risk impact from both the counterparty and your own perspectives.
